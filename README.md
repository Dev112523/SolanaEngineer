### Hi there üëã
As one word,
I am focused on developing smart contracts on the Solana blockchain network.

Since 2020, I am working on Solana.(of course, with other chains together)

Please don't contact me for any other chain. I really like Solana ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

My familiar skills on Solana are:
- origin rust smart contract development of Solana
- anchor framework
- NFT market place with metaplex
- tokio async framework for test coverage in rust
- interacting with Serum, Mercurial, Bonfida, Raydium ...

I respect NDA. I will never share any my work what I signed NDA
